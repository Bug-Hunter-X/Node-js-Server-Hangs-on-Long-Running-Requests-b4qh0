# Node.js Server Hanging Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications where long-running requests can cause the server to hang and become unresponsive. The `server.js` file contains code that simulates a long-running task, blocking the event loop and preventing other requests from being processed. The `serverSolution.js` file provides a solution using asynchronous operations to prevent blocking.

## Problem

Node.js is single-threaded, and long-running operations in the main thread can block the event loop.  This prevents the server from handling new requests, leading to poor performance and potential crashes under load. 

## Solution

The solution involves using asynchronous operations (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, promises, async/await) to avoid blocking the event loop.  This allows Node.js to continue processing other requests while long-running tasks are executed in the background.
